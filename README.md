# ops201d8-class-experience
What is this repo all about?My repo is about my experience in ops201 and the challenges I faced  throughout the course.

Why are you learning these skills?I'am learning these skills because I always wanted to learn about cybersecurity since I was a kid and this is a great way to better myself and the people around me.

What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?I learned the basics of writing in bash and making scripts in powershell to knowing how to navigate through computer systems and virtual machines.

What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?My favorite code assignement was code challenge six.The reason why code challenge six was my favorite is because I felt like that was the first time I got a chance to kind of freestyle and create my own script.

What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?Truthfully I have learned a lot but i know that im not efficient in doing the scripts well  just yet so i want to learn everything.

What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?Like I stated in the previous question I would like to learn everything but some aspects I would like to improve on are when and where to put symbols and the meanings of the symbols.

How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?I'll say In customer support because shell scripting can be used to automate tasks such as log analysis, ticket routing, and data collection. For example, a shell script could be used to monitor system logs for errors, or to collect diagnostic data from a customer's system for troubleshooting purposes.
